to run word spud, double click "main.py".

once you run it, put in your group size, 
then every player must individually put in their names.

if it says, "(insert your name here) is up",
you must make a phrase out of the word you're given.

if it says someone else's name instead, you must vote if you like it or not.

everyone but the player who made the phrase votes.

if someone likes the word,
the person who made the phrase is given 1 point, otherwise they lose 1 point.

this repeats for every player for about 2-8 rounds,
depending on the player count of this session.

a winner is declared, or maybe multiple.

either way, the highest score is shown,
along with the word chain everyone contributed to.

you are then prompted to exit the game with the enter key.

that's it for word spud, i hope you have fun playing.
